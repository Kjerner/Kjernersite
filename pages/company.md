## Kjerner is different

Kjerner has a new approach to building software solutions. To see it is to believe it, and we can show you amazing things in only a few hours. We use the [Alan platform](https://alan-platform.com). We took over development of the Alan platform from M-industries since the beginning of 2019.

## Partnership
We have partnered with OGD [OGD](https://ogd.nl) to make this platform available to as many companies and people as possible. With 1200 employees and a wide range of it services delivered, they have the size, organisation and wide expertise that fits perfectly with our innovative approach to software. Together, we can provide a solid basis of technical innovation, expertise, manpower and organisation. This makes it possible for you to depend on us for all of your needs, even strategic, large and long-term needs.

## Enterprise-ready Software

We use proven technology. Software built on the [Alan platform](https://alan-platform.com) is already supporting the daily operations of companies throughout Europe.

## Made Lightning Fast

The alan platform allows us to write software at lightning speed. You can use your software while prototyping and gain insights to make it smarter.

## Ready To Use

When a design session is over, your software is ready to use. Only when you decide to start using it, you will start paying for its usage.
