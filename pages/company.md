## Kjerner is different

Kjerner has a new approach to building software solutions. To see it is to believe it, and we can show you amazing things in only a few hours. We use the [Alan platform](https://alan-platform.com). We took over development of the Alan platform from M-industries since the beginning of 2019.

## Startup mentality

Kjerner and M-industries have been working with a relatively small development team of a little more than 10 people on our consultancy, software and platform at the same time. We kept the team small and tightly-nit to be able to stay agile and develop a platform that is innovative from the ground up. Going as far as developing our own parser and database technology on Alan as well, which made it possible to speed up our internal development by multiple factors as well. "Work smarter, not harder" and "Less is More" are the two important mottos we work and live by.

## Partnership
We have partnered with [OGD](https://ogd.nl) to make this platform available to as many companies and people as possible, as fast as possible. With 1200 employees and a wide range of it services delivered, OGD has the size, organisation and wide expertise that fits perfectly with our innovative approach to software. Together, we can provide a solid basis of technical innovation, expertise, manpower and organisation. This makes it possible for you to depend on us for all of your needs, even strategic, large and long-term needs.
